 # Suhaib

Hi there! I am a Data Scientist and Web Developer with a passion for turning complex data into beautiful and interactive visualizations. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages, including R, Python, SQL, Java, and C++.

## Skills
- Strong proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and statistics
- Familiarity with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Experience with popular data science libraries and frameworks such as Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- Knowledge of data visualization techniques and tools such as D3.js, Tableau, and ggplot2
- A knack for making terrible puns (i.e. "I may not be a smart cookie, but I can churn out some sweet data visualizations.")

## Projects
- [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/your-username/data-science-portfolio): A collection of my best data science projects, including analyses, visualizations, and models.
- [Web Development Portfolio](https://github.com/your-username/web-development-portfolio): A showcase of my web development skills, featuring responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing designs.
